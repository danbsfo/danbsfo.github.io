        <h2>About</h2>
	<p>My background is in computer science and cognitive science. I have worked with a wide breadth of technologies from BTLE using the Nordic SoftDevice stack for the NRF5122 chip to full stack web development with Python, React, Postgres to iOS development.</p>

         <h2>Projects</h2>
         <p>Here are some personal projects I've worked on over my career. Going forward, starting with Wrist Shot, I am working exclusively on projects that can elegantly solve problems I have to ensure their longevity. The prior projects taught interesting lessons including interesting impressions from their users.</p>

	 <h3>Wrist Shot <span class="date">2016</span></h3>
	   <div>
	     <p>Wrist Shot is a simple photo app that solves the problem of taking vertical videos (for those who consider that a problem, like me). It only permits you to take photos vertically and videos horizontally, so you turn your wrist to change between modes.</p>

	 <h3>Better Selfie <span class="date">2016</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/betterselfie.png" height="200" alt="better selfie">
             In late 2015 I was listening to NPR and someone was being interviewed about using social media. The person talked about how selfies had to be validated by friends before posting. I realized this process could be automated so I made Better Selfie, which crowdsourced ratings of your own selfies and applied Elo ratings to rank selfies.

	 <h3>Tactlet <span class="date">2015</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/tactlet.jpg" height="200" alt="tactlet">
	     The prior year I had been thinking a lot about an inexpensive wrist band that could be extensible in hardware, software, and fashion. I worked out a small hardware design using the Nordic NRF51822, an accelerometer, and a small battery. I paid an EE to make the circuit as compact as possible, and then used CircuitHub to produce a few dozen. I had a plan for gaining traction, but it is hard to execute alone! I'm still keeping it in my thoughts.

	 <h3>BeerMeNow <span class="date">2015</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/beerme.jpg" height="200" alt="beermenow">
	     Pennsylvania has strict liquor laws. At the end of 2014 the state clarified a law about transporting alcohol: you could do it if you had a liquor license. I talked with a client I knew well and we decided to build an Uber for beer, only we didn't need drivers since restaurants had those already. Our app replaced a phone call and having to repeat your credit card number. I helped close two partner restaurants and built this iOS app along with the stack using HelloFax and Twilio.

	 <h3>MonetLisa <span class="date">2014</span></h3>

	     I'm a fan of art, so I thought it would be cool to use BTLE to create a 21st century placard. I learned KiCad and designed a Bluetooth circuit which I then had manufactured via CircuitHub. For placards I tried injection molding, but settled on having them machined out of plastic. A flatbed printer enabled me to print information on the placard and the bluetooth circuit fit snugly in the back. I developed an accompanying iOS app so when you were nearby a Beacon would produce a notification. I gave one of these to Zach Braff along with a work of art. He probably wondered "WTF is this?" and threw it out.

	 <h3>TeslaPOI <span class="date">2014</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     I built an app using Angular.js to map places nearby Tesla superchargers. While superchargers are wildly fast, it can still take over an hour to fully charge an 85kWh battery. The idea with this app was to encourage road tripping. It gained a few users from the Tesla forum. I even debugged the app to get it to work with the web browser in Model S.

	 <h3>JoyBox <span class="date">2013</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/joybox.png" height="200" alt="joybox">
	     Frequenting coffee shops, baristas play a lot of different music. One I know suggested making an app to allow customers to select songs from the barista's iPhone to play. The app had a gaming system so you could use more credits to remove a song that was added.

	 <h3>Pro Football Playkepper <span class="date">2012</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/pfpk.png" height="200" alt="pfpk">
	     This was an app to allow people to keep track of football games like they keep track of baseball games. The specific endgame I had in mind was actually entirely different but this was a necessary step. The app had a small userbase. I built it in a matter of days and launched it right at the start of football.
	   </p>
	 </div>
	 <h3>Agitates.me <span class="date">2011</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     I observed that people need an outlet for frustrating day to day things. Getting cut off on the road or having a bad customer service experience? Go to agitates.me and get it off your chest. One thing that surprised me was that after I shut it down people were asking what happened to it.

	 <h3>Creepy Button <span class="date">2010</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/creepy.png" height="200">
	     Someone at a coffee shop was talking about how he wanted to make a button like the "Easy Button" but for instances when something was "creepy," a common phrase at the time. For fun we made an app with some pre-recorded voices saying "That was creepy!" and allowed the user to record their own.
	   </p>
	 </div>
	 <h3>Synomem <span class="date">2010</span></h3>
	 <div>
 	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/synomem.png" height="200" alt="synomem">
   	     Developed a free iOS game of memory with synonyms. As the player tapped a tile, it may show a word like "baffled." Instead of finding another "baffled" tile, the player would have to discover a word like "nonplussed."
	   </p>
	 </div>	
	 <h3>Spokerator <span class="date">2009</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/spokerator.png" height="200" alt="spokerator">
	     When I was in high school I wrote some software in Visual C++. My cousin wanted me to develop a spoke length calculator for bicycles. For whatever reason I never finished that project, but while testing the iPhone market I recreated it in Objective C. I sold it for $2.99 and the daily volume was less than Simple Park but still made a fair amount. I meant to improve the app, but instead ended up just removing it rather than keep pace with Apple's updates.
	   </p>
	 </div>
	 <h3>Simple Park <span class="date">2009</span></h3>
	 <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/simplepark.png" height="200" alt="simple park">
	     In 2009 I decided to test the app store market by selling a simple utility for keeping track of where you parked your car. At the time the app store wasn't quite saturated, so I was able to see a steady stream of sales. I made the mistake of allowing iPod touch users to download it, and some discovered the app didn't work without wifi.

	 <h3>Gathergo <span class="date">2008</span></h3>
         <div>
	   <p>
	     <img align="right" src="projects/loyalty.png" height="200" alt="gathergo">
	     My friend Derek and I always had trouble figuring out where to go. We had started Gathergo in late 2006 using PHP and Postgres. At the time the only way to find out about places to go was to use [C]itySearch. I bought a GPS, PDA, and microprinter and programmed the PDA in C# to work with the two so I could go around to local businesses, collect their GPS coordinates, take photos, and print them a "join code." The strategy was to have excellent data, but people searched for info and left the site. We pivoted multiple times and ended trying to create a loyalty system in 2010 that was different than others: we had physical loyalty cards because older people didn't use smartphones. Incidentally, it is still a pain to try to figure out where to go.
