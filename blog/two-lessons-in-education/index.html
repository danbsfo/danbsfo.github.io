<h2 id="two-computer-science-programs">Two Computer Science Programs</h2>
<p>In high school, I participated in a summer program at a university that is consistently tied for the best computer science department in the world. One of the courses I took was Introduction to Computer Science focusing on the C programming language, but at the end of the course there was an option to take the final exam for the version of the course CS majors take. The deal was, if you took that test you had to accept your grade. A handful of us studied for this while the rest of the students were enjoying a closing ceremony event. I earned an A.</p>
<p>The college I ultimately attended did not have a highly ranked computer science department. I thought I could transfer the credit. They declined. I had a meeting with the dean, and he told me to just take the course. I begrudgingly agreed.</p>
<p>He was right. It is one of the few schools to teach Lisp, and teach it well. You&rsquo;d learn recursion, tail recursion, and how to write code that had no state. Brilliant. Despite this school not being competitive it was an incredible education in computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, formal verification, and research.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The top schools have a lot of smart students and professors learning and teaching in python<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;d take this education any day.</p>
<h2 id="two-introduction-to-java-courses">Two Introduction to Java Courses</h2>
<p>The next lesson was during my tenure as an undergraduate assistant helping with an introduction to Java course. I did this for two semesters. For the first semester, the professor has students build a graphical game. These are not computer science students and have a high likelihood that this was their first time coding. I&rsquo;ve never before seen office hours packed with students during that first week. It was hot, sweaty, and students were overflowing from the room. The professor had assigned them a task of drawing the game board or something absurd of that nature.</p>
<p>The following semester had a different professor teaching introduction to Java. He started out with the basics, hello world, and receiving input from the console and manipulating it. Eventually there was some graphics. Office hours were a free study period for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of bias since some students dropped the first semester and enrolled in the second semester, but overwhelmingly the first group of students were better off. This makes sense. A psychological study known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law">Yerkes-Dodson Law</a> showed that there is a sweet spot for stress. Too much stress is bad. Too little stress is unproductive. You don&rsquo;t benefit unless you have a little fire under you.</p>

<p>In any computer science program you are going to learn more than one language. We also did Java, C, 68000.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
