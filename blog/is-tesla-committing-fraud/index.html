I&rsquo;ll begin with a full disclaimer that I&rsquo;ve contributed non-dilutive capital to Tesla and I&rsquo;m also a shareholder. I&rsquo;ll continue to be a shareholder (as part of my risk portfolio), and plan on buying future Tesla products.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a believer in almost everything Elon Musk has developed or begun to develop, including controversial technologies like SpaceX&rsquo;s satellite Internet<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> and Boring Company tunnels (despite the lackluster launch). There is one technology, however, which is being sold by Tesla that is dubious which is Full Self Driving.</p>

<p>My background is in cognitive science and computer science, and I&rsquo;ve built hardware and software for ambulatory and wheeled robots, though I&rsquo;m not an expert in self driving cars. Even so, experts like (Google guy) and Rodney Brooks who cofounded iRobot weigh heavily on the matter. I&rsquo;ve interacted with Google&rsquo;s self-driving cars on bike in the streets of Mountain View and that sort of thing is a real eye-opener &ndash; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in a self-driving car in a dangerous part of the city.</p>
