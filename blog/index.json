        "body": "Participating in the transition from Blockbuster through Netflix online streaming service was an interesting lesson in change of market dynamics. Netflix realized you could be cost effective at sending DVDs through the mail, while Blockbuster snoozed assuming people would browse in store forever. Sure, browsing in real life is an experience, but it was also something of an annoyance for similar reasons why Amazon was successful1.\nFor a while, around 2012 or so, it seemed like Netflix and streaming were the future. But it, too, has had difficulty negotiating deals for desired content with the competition heating up from other services such as Amazon and HBO. Turning to Hollywood to create original content, it seemed like it was off to a good start with the series House of Cards.\nBut as A-list content dwindled, the pressure was on. Netflix had to produce more original content and it tried to hype up shows like Marco Polo which ended in failure. Shows like Orange is the New Black, Narcos, and Stranger Things helped, but rising subscriber costs contributed to its struggle2. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to see any recently widely talked about content as they ramp up efforts to try to see what sticks3.\nMany people already had Amazon Prime when they launched Amazon Prime Video. Amazon has also had mediocre success with original content. Jack Ryan is probably the most talked about, but Amazon, too, has a lengthy list of never-heard-of-this-before original content4.\nAnother popular streaming service is HBO Now, which has been able to leverage its A-list content from the cable service with clout frequently advertised by hotels everywhere, HBO. Most well known content-wise here is Game of Thrones but has done well with newer series such as Westworld and Succession.\nHBO Now is actually how I developed my current viewing habits. When it was launched I subscribed to the service just to watch Silicon Valley and then promptly canceled. An ancillary benefit was access to all the A-list content for the month.\nI started doing this around 2015 or 2016, and fast-forward to 2018 when Amazon Prime was due to be renewed. Amazon had just increased the price for a Prime membership, and the benefits were questionable. Shortly after declining to renew Amazon Prime, I also axed Netflix.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t reactivated any of these services since, but I know the desirable content has started to queue up. Jack Ryan was indeed a worthy series. So at some point, just like HBO Now, I\u0026rsquo;ll spin up a Prime Video membership for the month before canceling. This will happen with Netflix as well. Ideally I\u0026rsquo;d subscribe to a service one month and cascade other services in subsequent months.\nAn exception here is Disney Plus. The content, at present, seems to be so good that it will be worth it to just pay for the service month to month without giving it much thought. Disney Plus is also interesting because one of Netflix\u0026rsquo;s pillars is children\u0026rsquo;s content. Imagine busy parents that need an hour a day and let their kids have some screen time. Would they prefer to just pay $10 a month for Netflix or risk subjecting their kids to content from randos on Youtube5?\nIn the end it may seem rather miserly to forgo a whole $3606 a year on content and services that could prove beneficial in situations like being stuck in an airport or on a long car ride. $330, however, is a lot of money for most people. You could go out to a nice dinner for two a few times over, or buy a nicer car, or contribute that money to Watsi7. But I think it speaks more about how the business model of streaming services is broken. It\u0026rsquo;s a commodity8 and the only reason to have the service is if you truly like content that hasn\u0026rsquo;t entered the zeitgeist like House of Cards or Game of Thrones, or if you really feel compelled to have water cooler conversations about the latest episode on Monday morning. Disney Plus will be an interesting service to follow. It seems like it has the hallmark of success with so much A-list content, and if you\u0026rsquo;ve been paying attention Star Wars is everywhere.\nUpdate: I forgot I had wanted to contrast video streaming with music services (I wrote this post quickly because otherwise I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have written anything). Music services like Spotify and Apple Music are perfect for platform lock-in. It makes sense to pay $10-$15 a month\n Amazon took the pain away of not finding the book you want in bookstores. Similarly, Netflix took the pain away of settling for some B-list movie because there were no other options in the Blockbuster you were browsing.

        "body": "I consider myself a crypto altruist; I don\u0026rsquo;t subscribe to any sort of maximalism of any cryptocurrency. I want to see everyone have access to this technology regardless of the particular implementation, so long as it is entirely open source and has been peer reviewed by computer scientists1.\nWhen I began studying cryptocurrencies a few years ago, I recognized that they were flawed. They require untold amounts of data to store the timechain, and perhaps worse the computing power and lengthy confirmation time make monetary transactions as we know them impossible. Digging through research papers, I learned how challenging of a problem it was to ensure speed, security, and decentralization.\nIt seemed like Bitcoin \u0026ndash; and especially Ethereum \u0026ndash; were unsustainable in terms of space and computing power required, not to mention they practically violate the ethos of a decentralized money system with mining being highly concentrated2. To me, it seemed the path forward was something that worked well on mobile devices, or else how would cryptocurrency be adopted by billions of people? Since then a few solutions have surfaced that intend to work on mobile or by leveraging trusted computing centers in conjunction with a mobile solution. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if any of these will ultimately succeed, but few if any people in the crypto community seem to support them. For reference, Celo is approximately what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about here, if it works.\nFred Wilson said a couple years ago that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if Ethereum surpassed Bitcoin in value3. This makes sense as Ethereum has the potential for people to develop applications on the platform that grow in value. Ethereum has an excellent ecosystem and the tooling is fantastic4. It is likely Ethereum will end up being of some non-trivial value in 10 years because of the wealth created via Ethereum apps. I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt, however, that there will be plenty of competition. Programmers are unfortunately fickle. Ruby on Rails was the hottest thing 10 years ago, and now we have Go, Rust, Swift, Node, and dozens of frameworks that associate with those5.\nImagine a Magic the Gathering is built on Tezos or EOS or Ethereum, \u0026amp;c. It has a lot of followers that know all about the cards and play the game, creating value. A friend sends a card (token) to my wallet as a gift. Thank you, but I\u0026rsquo;m not into Magic the Gathering. My wallet tells me it is worth $250 \u0026ndash; awesome! Do I put it up for sale, hold on to it, or buy more Magic cards in hopes they will be worth even more one day? As a gift I may hold on to it, at least for some time. But likely I\u0026rsquo;ll sell it or trade it for something I am more familiar with. Cash? Gold? Those things are minted in central banks and possibly mined in asteroids6. If I want to buy a used Apple Watch or I want jewlery, sure. Instead maybe I trade it for a token that is pegged to a stock with solid fundamentals, or maybe I put it in a store of value that has proven historically to increase in value over the long term. Those seem immensely easier options. And if you are someone who dismisses crypto, read Green Eggs and Ham and then try donating to Watsi or the Internet Archive with it; less friction always wins.\nBitcoin is a store of value. It has brand recognition. The social challenge of overcoming its dominance is like campaigning Kay Jewelers to be more valuable than Tiffany. Fork market caps pale to Bitcoin, and even if they succeeded you\u0026rsquo;d still own it. Exceptional value is also Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s biggest problem. Lightning was designed to enable instantaneous low fee transactions, but you need to stake Bitcoin. As an appreciating asset why stake it? People who were early to Bitcoin and have spent it might casually participate, but the users being onboarded today are unlikely to do this. In the US there are tax implications which is a huge turnoff to spending an appreciating asset like Bitcoin. This is just the reality. Perhaps legislation changes the landscape here.\nThe development that has me convinced Bitcoin will continue to be a store of value and the dominant of all cryptocurrencies is the rise of stable coins7. Stable coins are ideally pegged to the US Dollar, and while there are small fluctuations I suspect there will soon be some kind of exemption for taxes in the US. Stable coins will be used for day to day transactions. No rational person is going to want to trade their Bitcoin if they think it is going to continue to rise in value!\nPeople will transact daily in stable coins, they will buy virtual goods on Ethereum and it will wax and wane in value, new networks will emerge and also wax and wane, but Bitcoin will remain the strongest store of value.\n By \u0026ldquo;computer scientists\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t mean people who hold degrees necessarily, but anyone who is capable of building a blockchain from scratch. A consensus on the merits of the technology is what matters, not nitpicking. [return] I realize this is a contested point. Ideally you\u0026rsquo;d have x nodes and 1/x nodes odds of earning a reward, but I digress. [return] People misquote him as saying \u0026ldquo;he thinks it will\u0026rdquo; when in fact he said he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised. [return] I built Glossy.cards, an ERC721 creator to sell collectibles for free, using Golang with the assistance of geth, web3, Metamask, Infura. (Sure, infura is a crutch, but Ethereum is still in development). Was impressed so much production-ready infrastructure was built in such a short time. [return] Would be great if y\u0026rsquo;all just decided on one language for professional purposes and used the rest for hobby. I vote for a LISP; Clojure is ok I guess. Risp? Maybe something that supports tail call optimization. [return] Seems like science fiction, but so does decelerating rockets and landing them on small pads in a rough ocean. [return] It\u0026rsquo;s not lost on me that Bitcoin could one day be measured in terms of stable coins which themselves will have intrinsic value. [return]   "

        "body": "I still go to the grocery store in part for the experience and the discovery process. Often times, however, I’ve wished I could just skip the store and have the groceries appear within a day. The problem with that is then I need to sign up for some delivery service and still spend time paging through an app to find dozens of necessities.\nI have tried a few services including Instacart and Amazon Now, and both worked out fine except for the economics. On top of the cost of groceries is an added percentage, fee, and tip. What’s hard for me to understand is why these companies aren’t able to tap into the fixed costs of a traditional supermarket. While supermarket net margins tends to be around 1.7%, gross margins are in the 20% range.\nThere are over a dozen Safeway supermarket stores in San FranciscoConsidering the costs of real estate, utilities, employees, logistics, and insurance, it seems there should be enough for this service:\nInstead of 15 stores, situate 3 warehouses in the vicinity of Excelsior, Dogpatch, and Inner Sunset (i.e. highways and center of mass)Automate the warehouses so that pallets come off the trucks from supplier and are robotically transported to their row and bin; individual items are robotically retrieved to fill a shopping bagThe store employees are now delivery drivers. Bags are robotically loaded into the vans so the driver just has to get in and follow an efficient route and unload the bags to homes, offices, car trunks, \u0026amp;c.The above seems reasonably doable, so I wonder why no one does it. Even if certain aspects aren’t automated from the start, it can be done over time.\nWhat about perishable items? I think instead of bags reusable crates could be used with built in icepack. Since I consistently demolish large boxes from Amazon I’m not sure why they haven’t gone reusable yet, though with their own fleet it seems likely to be on their roadmap.\nWhat about stolen groceries? I think stolen groceries would be about as likely as stolen Amazon packages. Some neighborhoods may be more susceptible, especially in San Francisco, so having items delivered to work or a car trunk may be a solution.\nLastly, if the vision weren’t already over the top, I think combining groceries with a “chef meal” service makes sense. That is, you get chopped vegetables and other ingredients along with a recipe so you can make a fancy dinner with ease. Maybe this would be a premium service, but hopefully far cheaper than current services with this offering.\n  "

        "section": "blog",
        "date" : "2016.11.27",
        "body": "Hyperloop concept from the original SpaceX white paper.Were I to create a hyperloop company I may call it R-Loop to emphasize keeping out the hype. If I was lucky maybe one day it would be known simply as “The R” just as elevated trains in Philly and Chicago are known as “The El.”\nIt’s been just a couple years since two major hyperloop companies have been in existence and the outlook is dubious. Hyperloop One had a cofounder breakup which is often an ominous sign in startups, and there hasn’t been much news of the other company. Even if these companies don’t succeed someone will take the opportunity and figure out how to execute.\nIn a place like the Bay Area, the hyperloop could mean an alternative to local governments who refuse to build new housing. Why commute by car from Berkeley over to San Francisco which could take over 45 minutes each way, when you could hyperloop into San Francisco in 20 to 30 minutes? Even assuming self-driving vehicles eventually earn a comparable time, housing costs are still problematic.\nBrisbane, a city adjacent to San Francisco, recently rejected a proposal to build thousands of new units on this large plot of land which has two 101 exits and a Caltrain station. Driving through it at night you’d think you were in wine country.I asked my friend who is a city planner from MIT what San Francisco could do to relieve the problem. He replied that properties need to stop being used as unoccupied investment vehicles and the city should let loose on high rise construction, particularly in former industrial areas like SoMa, which allows for a compromise to preserve the character of neighborhoods like Noe Valley. So far few Bay Area cities are making efforts to allow for vast new home construction.\nI realized, like many others probably, that hyperloop could solve this problem by connecting San Francisco to more rural areas and building an expandable city there. I ran this idea by my friend who told me newly planned cities almost never succeed, and it is far better to improve existing cities. But you know, Wall Street traders from Wharton and venture capitalists from Stanford and city planners from MIT excel at learning from history; one thing they have in common is they can’t predict the future very well.\nThe kind of effect the hyperloop has on society may be predicted by recalling the effects of new technologies like the railroad or air travel, but history can’t tell us what happens when we have multiple technologies that are only a decade or two old working together. Just as Tesla was able to mark billions in preorders for the Model III, we could use the Internet to propose a new city for which a hyperloop company has worked out a route. A developer could take preorders for home plans, and the hyperloop company could get to work. Some attrition may occur, but also augmentation once the city becomes a reality. Would people buy a home site unseen? For the current generation of homebuyers the answer may be yes. Everything is bought online today, even cars. What is more important is if friends are also buying in the city and how easy it is to get to San Francisco or Portland.\nBeing in such a new city provides more opportunity. Let’s assume the new city is around Eureka, CA. Someone who lives there decides to leave their San Francisco job for a job in Portland, so their commute goes from 20 minutes to 30 minutes one way. After work on Friday they decide to head to San Francisco to get an Impossible Burger at Cockscomb with old friends. No big deal, just a 50 minute hyperloop ride from work and a 20 minute hyperloop ride back home.\nHyperloop could create new cities between San Francisco and Portland.All of this is predicated on a hyperloop company successfully creating the technology and making money. But I think once that happens, public and private sectors will recognize the incredible opportunity and devote resources to seizing it. People will buy land, create crowdfunding campaigns, secure bank loans, new homes and parks will be created, new cafes and businesses will rise, and the quality of life will be among the best.\n  "
