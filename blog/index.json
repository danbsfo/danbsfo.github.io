I still go to the grocery store in part for the experience and the discovery process. Often times, however, I’ve wished I could just skip the store and have the groceries appear within a day. The problem with that is then I need to sign up for some delivery service and still spend time paging through an app to find dozens of necessities.\nI have tried a few services including Instacart and Amazon Now, and both worked out fine except for the economics. On top of the cost of groceries is an added percentage, fee, and tip. What’s hard for me to understand is why these companies aren’t able to tap into the fixed costs of a traditional supermarket. While supermarket net margins tends to be around 1.7%, gross margins are in the 20% range.\nThere are over a dozen Safeway supermarket stores in San FranciscoConsidering the costs of real estate, utilities, employees, logistics, and insurance, it seems there should be enough for this service:\nInstead of 15 stores, situate 3 warehouses in the vicinity of Excelsior, Dogpatch, and Inner Sunset (i.e. highways and center of mass)Automate the warehouses so that pallets come off the trucks from supplier and are robotically transported to their row and bin; individual items are robotically retrieved to fill a shopping bagThe store employees are now delivery drivers. Bags are robotically loaded into the vans so the driver just has to get in and follow an efficient route and unload the bags to homes, offices, car trunks, \u0026amp;c.The above seems reasonably doable, so I wonder why no one does it. Even if certain aspects aren’t automated from the start, it can be done over time.\nWhat about perishable items? I think instead of bags reusable crates could be used with built in icepack. Since I consistently demolish large boxes from Amazon I’m not sure why they haven’t gone reusable yet, though with their own fleet it seems likely to be on their roadmap.\nWhat about stolen groceries? I think stolen groceries would be about as likely as stolen Amazon packages. Some neighborhoods may be more susceptible, especially in San Francisco, so having items delivered to work or a car trunk may be a solution.\nLastly, if the vision weren’t already over the top, I think combining groceries with a “chef meal” service makes sense. That is, you get chopped vegetables and other ingredients along with a recipe so you can make a fancy dinner with ease. Maybe this would be a premium service, but hopefully far cheaper than current services with this offering.\n \n"},{"ref":"https://dan.bulwinkle.net/blog/hyperloop-may-create-new-cities/","title":"Hyperloop May Create New Cities","section":"blog","date":"2016.11.27","body":"City Planning and Real Estate Markets May Become Vastly Different If Hyperloop Succeeds Hyperloop concept from the original SpaceX white paper.Were I to create a hyperloop company I may call it R-Loop to emphasize keeping out the hype. If I was lucky maybe one day it would be known simply as “The R” just as elevated trains in Philly and Chicago are known as “The El.”\nIt’s been just a couple years since two major hyperloop companies have been in existence and the outlook is dubious. Hyperloop One had a cofounder breakup which is often an ominous sign in startups, and there hasn’t been much news of the other company. Even if these companies don’t succeed someone will take the opportunity and figure out how to execute.\nIn a place like the Bay Area, the hyperloop could mean an alternative to local governments who refuse to build new housing. Why commute by car from Berkeley over to San Francisco which could take over 45 minutes each way, when you could hyperloop into San Francisco in 20 to 30 minutes? Even assuming self-driving vehicles eventually earn a comparable time, housing costs are still problematic.\nBrisbane, a city adjacent to San Francisco, recently rejected a proposal to build thousands of new units on this large plot of land which has two 101 exits and a Caltrain station. Driving through it at night you’d think you were in wine country.I asked my friend who is a city planner from MIT what San Francisco could do to relieve the problem. He replied that properties need to stop being used as unoccupied investment vehicles and the city should let loose on high rise construction, particularly in former industrial areas like SoMa, which allows for a compromise to preserve the character of neighborhoods like Noe Valley. So far few Bay Area cities are making efforts to allow for vast new home construction.\nI realized, like many others probably, that hyperloop could solve this problem by connecting San Francisco to more rural areas and building an expandable city there. I ran this idea by my friend who told me newly planned cities almost never succeed, and it is far better to improve existing cities. But you know, Wall Street traders from Wharton and venture capitalists from Stanford and city planners from MIT excel at learning from history; one thing they have in common is they can’t predict the future very well.\nThe kind of effect the hyperloop has on society may be predicted by recalling the effects of new technologies like the railroad or air travel, but history can’t tell us what happens when we have multiple technologies that are only a decade or two old working together. Just as Tesla was able to mark billions in preorders for the Model III, we could use the Internet to propose a new city for which a hyperloop company has worked out a route. A developer could take preorders for home plans, and the hyperloop company could get to work. Some attrition may occur, but also augmentation once the city becomes a reality. Would people buy a home site unseen? For the current generation of homebuyers the answer may be yes. Everything is bought online today, even cars. What is more important is if friends are also buying in the city and how easy it is to get to San Francisco or Portland.\nBeing in such a new city provides more opportunity. Let’s assume the new city is around Eureka, CA. Someone who lives there decides to leave their San Francisco job for a job in Portland, so their commute goes from 20 minutes to 30 minutes one way. After work on Friday they decide to head to San Francisco to get an Impossible Burger at Cockscomb with old friends. No big deal, just a 50 minute hyperloop ride from work and a 20 minute hyperloop ride back home.\nHyperloop could create new cities between San Francisco and Portland.All of this is predicated on a hyperloop company successfully creating the technology and making money. But I think once that happens, public and private sectors will recognize the incredible opportunity and devote resources to seizing it. People will buy land, create crowdfunding campaigns, secure bank loans, new homes and parks will be created, new cafes and businesses will rise, and the quality of life will be among the best.\n \n"}]
