        "body": "Some years ago I saw a well-known1 investor on Twitter say, in effect, that if he decided not to invest in you, don\u0026rsquo;t ask for referrals.\nFrom an investor\u0026rsquo;s perspective, this often makes perfect sense. Great investors place their money with people they believe will succeed, and perhaps there were so many red flags the investor couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly recommend the entrepreneur to anyone.\nIf the investor is talking to the entrepreneur in the first place, however, it probably means they passed some kind of initial screen: they aren\u0026rsquo;t completely out there. There are countless stories where investors declined entrepreneurs early on like multiple decacorn company builders Dorsey and Musk.\nDon Valentine did not initially invest in Apple2. Instead, he referred Mike Markkula to Steve Jobs. Markkula invested first, then Valentine invested with Sequoia a year later. Can you imagine if Don Valentine simply brushed them off and said no? I may not be talking about Don Valentine right now, for one.\nMost venture capital firms have an investment thesis that is procured to their LPs. Angel and seed investors have their own verticals and criteria for investing. The narrow scope of these theses precludes at least some power law wins. After all, I know of no thesis that is, \u0026ldquo;Invest only in companies that will go public.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have traction on my college social network\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We are a B2B outfit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have an idea for an electric car.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Oh, we only invest in software.\u0026rdquo;\nA great investor will try to help in some way. They may know someone in their network who has a completely different perspective. If that person invests they can turn around and reason with the first investor, or the first investor can still have a way in to the next round. It\u0026rsquo;s also just good business.\n  I don\u0026rsquo;t quite recall who it was. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2422032 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

        "body": "Version 0.9\n When ordering pizza for pickup, there is no easier way to do it than using a phone. On average, it takes no more than 20 seconds:\n Dial number Say: \u0026ldquo;Large Pizza for Pickup\u0026rdquo; Hear: \u0026ldquo;OK. 15-20 minutes.\u0026rdquo;  There are many, many websites and apps that partner with local pizza shops. Often these apps require you to sign up or add excess information. Why is one required to put in first name, last name, phone, email, and address when phone number and first name is all that\u0026rsquo;s required when calling?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s worse is that almost all of these apps require you to \u0026ldquo;sign up.\u0026rdquo; This is one of those situations where signing up is irrelevant, just like with most mobile apps1. In theory I should be able to autocomplete first name and phone number (maybe credit card2) and voil√† my pizza is in queue. Signing up for yet-another-food-service-app is a turn off.\nThat technology is causing more friction than less isn\u0026rsquo;t surprising. It seems recently that a lot of technology does this. An obvious example is captcha. We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have hilarious coffee drinking robot commercials without it!\nIf only the solution were so simple as to build an app that only required first name and phone number (and dumped that info or just store it in localstorage). The biggest issue of course is getting the menu items into the system. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s not even necessary. Why not just have an image of a menu and a box where you type the order. \u0026ldquo;Extra large pizza, half green peppers and onions, half extra cheese.\u0026rdquo; Already this system feels like it would in the worst case match a phone call, but probably cut that time in half \u0026ndash; especially if utilizing localstorage. Maybe one day technology can play a role in improving user experience rather than destroying it.\n  Mobile apps can create unique device identifiers, and on iOS they can also leverage iCloud to store information when moving to new devices. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n This shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be necessary, but if for some reason people are submitting fake pizza requests I guess it could be required. People still use cash; something I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing recently as a mechanism for budgeting. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

        "body": "The mystery surrounding the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin, has been entertaining and somewhat frustrating to observe. When that reporter found a random guy with the name Nakamoto and turned his life upside down, it was probably peak \u0026ldquo;we have no idea who this is\u0026rdquo; and yet it is still frustrating to see from time to time bright people say, \u0026ldquo;Aha! It is x!\u0026rdquo; with weak evidence.\nSatoshi wanted to stay anonymous, and for good reason. If Bitcoin worked, everyone would be after him1. Personally I didn\u0026rsquo;t adopt Bitcoin sooner out of fear of alternative money laws in the US, so imagine creating an alternative money! Then, as it grows more successful, the early mining activity attributed to Satoshi is worth enough to be competitive with the wealthiest individuals in the world. The wealthiest people have \u0026ldquo;security teams.\u0026rdquo; Satoshi, I guarantee, does not have nor want a security team.\nA few years ago I myself was curious so I looked at the genesis of Bitcoin. Based on that story I chose one person and compared that person\u0026rsquo;s code with the code that Satoshi Nakamoto initially distributed. Next I checked that person\u0026rsquo;s writing with Satoshi\u0026rsquo;s writing. The code and writing were very similar. The two people\u0026rsquo;s characters were similar. What was different? Well, if you were going to try to conceal your identity you\u0026rsquo;d want good opsec but you\u0026rsquo;d also want to be good at counterintelligence. Since Satoshi has fooled almost everyone23, I\u0026rsquo;d say he did those things well.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t disclose who I think Satoshi is directly. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of unveiling who it is? If the person wants others to know directly that he is Satoshi then he will do so. In fact, I think one day he may. Here I will only make three claims: Satoshi is one person, he is still alive, and he identifies as \u0026ldquo;he.\u0026rdquo; I was wrong in my estimation of the identity of Startup L Jackson4 so certainly I could be wrong about Satoshi. But for fun here is a hash of a unique sentence stating his identity:\nae5822f1add18cf25046267de7ede6fea25a512ce06b3d51dbafbcf3e2d7ed7b/512256\n  Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m making a claim on gender here. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Amusingly, Gwern touches on it in confusion. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There are a few randos who make claims, but without evidence. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I thought it was Hunter Walk, but to be fair I didn\u0026rsquo;t read through their source code. Also a bit different circumstance: SLJ was a persona created by Thompson and Satoshi merely applies techniques to conceal true identity. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

From time to time, this would get a small number of upvotes.\nAfter a while I started wondering why people were submitting this so frequently. Reviewing the bookmarklet page, it suddenly became clear2. Logged-in HN users were clicking the link which would then submit the bookmarklet page itself to Hacker News. At some point these links were simply automatically marked dead whenever submitted.\n But, there is a better (and simple) solution! Just add javascript to prevent the default behavior. The yellow highlighted text below shows the change.\n This allows users to drag the bookmarklet to their toolbar while preventing them from accidentally submitting to HN. An ancillary benefit is that, due to how YC titles their pages, it will no longer be known as \u0026ldquo;Y Combinator Bookmarklet.\u0026rdquo;\n  This seems to be a problem with HN. First, there should be a preference where landing on /new is the default.

        "date" : "2020.02.23",
        "body": " In February 2000, Peter Thiel and Elon Musk met at a cafe on University Avenue in Palo Alto to discuss merging Confinity and X.com, their respective companies. Here is how Thiel tells it in Zero to One:\n If you can\u0026rsquo;t beat a rival, it may be better to merge. By late 1999, we were in an all out war\u0026hellip; the focus was defeating X.com. In February 2000, Elon and I were more scared about a rapidly inflating tech bubble than we were about each other: a financial crash would ruin us both before we could finish our fight. Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that\u0026rsquo;s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground.1\n PayPal went on to become a powerful company that today has a market cap of $140 billion. We\u0026rsquo;ll never know what would have happened if Thiel and Musk hadn\u0026rsquo;t agreed on a 50/50 merger. There is a realm of possibility including the unspoken idea that both companies survived and competition drove innovation \u0026ndash; something to keep in mind.\nIn recent years, I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that there aren\u0026rsquo;t more mergers of the same kind. Not paltry acquihires, but rather taking two companies that are otherwise forces with strong teams that would mesh well together.2 It\u0026rsquo;s possible to object with a claim that maybe a weaker company ought to die out; however, we continue to see Y Combinator fund competitors who don\u0026rsquo;t seem to come to the realization that merging is an option. Y Combinator doesn\u0026rsquo;t fund ideas, it funds founders, and so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t follow that \u0026ldquo;the weak die out\u0026rdquo; unless Y Combinator was mistaken in their assessment of accepting founders into the accelerator.\nOne of the earliest examples of this that comes to mind is Balanced Payments, which launched in 2012 a couple years after Stripe. One of the distinguished features of Balanced was an API that allowed developers to integrate marketplaces. Stripe eventually added this feature, but Balanced was reportedly processing $370 million a year in early 2014.3 In 2015 Balanced shut down, and Stripe\u0026rsquo;s co-founder Patrick Collison called it \u0026ldquo;bittersweet.\u0026quot;4 What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that Balanced and Stripe are both Y Combinator companies. Presumably they each had equal access to the resources and advice Y Combinator provides. Without knowing the details of the shut down, it seems odd that the company wouldn\u0026rsquo;t merge with Stripe. Were they drowning in lawsuits? The value of the merger wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exceed the cost of merging? Stripe\u0026rsquo;s valuation dwarfed Balanced\u0026rsquo;s?\nY Combinator seems to be the perfect place for mergers. Every winter for the past three winters, Y Combinator has funded a podcasting company. In winter 2017, Breaker. In winter 2018, The Podcast App. And in winter 2019, Brew. TechCrunch even makes a note of this:\n The accelerator still admits many international copycats of U.S. successes, and YC is also repeating itself a bit. The Podcast App pitched the exact same product and strategy as Breaker, which debuted at YC exactly a year ago.5\n So, great! Admit them. Advise them. Shower them with resources. But why not suggest a merger at some point? Is there room for 3 podcasting apps? In addition to these there is Stitcher, Marco Arment\u0026rsquo;s Overcast, and the native Podcast app (on iOS at least). So many apps in such a small market is inefficient.\nOne more instance of two Y Combinator companies that would be fit for merging are Yoshi and YourMechanic. YourMechanic started out with a bang; they built something people wanted and had some excellent blog posts which marketed their product, but somehow the leadership disappeared and the company appears to have gone sideways. Yoshi started out with fuel delivery straight to your vehicle, but quickly encroached on YourMechanic\u0026rsquo;s market. It seemed obvious in recent years that these companies combine forces and merge. Instead of a single, efficient mobile mechanic workforce in the Bay Area, for example, there are two workforces and the overhead and marketing costs that go with them yielding less margin for profit (if any!).\nYes, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to know whether mergers in any of these instances are a good idea without knowing the details of the companies and the cap tables that go with them. But what\u0026rsquo;s surprising is that we rarely \u0026ndash; if ever \u0026ndash; see a TechCrunch headline announcing that two companies have joined forces. It\u0026rsquo;s even more surprising that we don\u0026rsquo;t see this from Y Combinator given the prevalance of companies they fund in similar markets.\n  Paraphrased from Zero to One \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n And, as noted by Thiel in Zero to One \u0026amp; Lechvin in Founders at Work the X-Confinity merger wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best meshing of teams but somehow was good enough to succeed \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/16/balanced-marketplace-payments/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9200145 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/these-are-the-64-startups-unveiled-at-y-combinator-w18-demo-day-2/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

        "body": "In spring of 2017 I was about to move from San Francisco down the peninsula. I had just decided to pause an ambitious side project that attempted to further unsupervised machine learning by automating clustering and instead turn my attention to another project dealing with art1. Y Combinator had announced their first startup school; I applied and was able to join a group of other entrepreneurial types.\nMy art project2 was going to sell physical art. I had developed an app that enabled people to browse and buy artworks with Stripe. Sounds prosaic but there was an angle of course. Even so, this endeavor was unfortunately not a sit-behind-the-screen and dominate3 type of project like my ambitious unsupervised machine learning project. It required that I go talk with customers and artists. üò±\nIt took time, but at the very least I was able to start emailing artists via a yearly Bay Area art event that produces a magazine with all of the participants\u0026rsquo;s contact info. I had a pretty good success rate and set up a meeting with one artist, with another meeting on the way. Not only was I making progress, but also discovered that when you tell artists that you want to sell their work, some want to hear more.\nAt this point it was about 4 or 5 weeks in, and things were moving too slowly. Yes, it is important to Do Things That Don\u0026rsquo;t Scale but I was treating this like it was Y Combinator\u0026rsquo;s actual program and if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to show by presentation day, why bother?\nSo I pivoted to another iOS app. This one leveraged the Lob printing API to produce post cards with artwork on it. The hypothesis was that people would want to send a postcard with artwork from the location they traveled to.\nAt the weekly meeting, the group lead Aaron Glazer, CEO of Taplytics, had a guest from his former YC Group. We were discussing what was holding us back, and my contribution usually went like this:\n I am thinking about trying to sell this concept to real estate agents to thank clients they\u0026rsquo;ve worked with. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;d want it.\n This may seem dumb, dear reader, but I believe a lot of people suffer from this fallacy. You find a reason why it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Disappearing photos would be great! But that won\u0026rsquo;t work because you can always take a photo of the photo or perhaps the more familiar Dropbox is something that could be trivially built with rsync and big tech solutions will be pervasive soon enough.\nSo during this meeting halfway through startup school these guys asked me: How do you know? And they didn\u0026rsquo;t just say it once. Every time I made an assertion they would ask me, \u0026ldquo;How do you know?\u0026rdquo; There is only one way to know whether something will work, and that is to test the market. You needn\u0026rsquo;t build anything! You could. You could build a prototype. You could produce a video like Drew Houston did with Dropbox. But if you have any assertion without evidence to back it up, you may as well trash it. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Is that so? How do you know that?4 Likewise, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know whether real estate agents would be interested in artwork postcards.\nAfter that call I did not follow up with real estate agents because I decided to pivot to augmented reality. But the lesson stuck with me. It is important to ask questions like whether it is the right time and what is the distribution strategy5, but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to make any assumptions without data.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard people talk about eliminating items from idea lists, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard advice on how to do that. Consider how awful the idea of AirBnB was. Paul Graham tried to convince AirBnB to change their idea!6 Probably what made it work was Michael Seibel\u0026rsquo;s advice to leverage Craigslist on both the supply and demand side as a distribution strategy.\nWhenever there is an idea I\u0026rsquo;m unsure of, it is now easy to think How do I know? If it is something reason would easily talk me out of like an AirBnB concept, I try to get some data. A handful of data points or a few posts on forums is not enough, just as it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough in a scientific setting. And as with science, I should at least be able to walk away from the experiment learning something new.\n  Unsupervised machine learning to art? Yes, quite a leap. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Not really a startup as there was no growth, right? \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Paul Graham may argue that you have to talk with customers either way. But a distribution strategy like that of YouTube (leveraging MySpace) or PayPal (leveraging EBay) did not mean having to arrange meetings with people, and in the case of PayPal the customer who sparked their genius emailed them. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Atheism makes no sense unless you are claiming that there is no god in the same way that people claim that there is a god. You can participate in innumerable sophistry contests, but there\u0026rsquo;s no way you can win every time. Just because it seems like there is no god doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it so! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n These are perhaps the two most important questions for a startup. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to be a bit early if you can weather it (for example, AR industry is probably going to proliferate when Apple launches glasses in a year or so). Distribution is key for growth. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1131337639540477954 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

        "body": "Participating in the transition from Blockbuster through Netflix online streaming service was an interesting lesson in change of market dynamics. Netflix realized you could be cost effective at sending DVDs through the mail, while Blockbuster snoozed assuming people would browse in store forever. Sure, browsing in real life is an experience, but it was also something of an annoyance for similar reasons why Amazon was successful1.\nFor a while, around 2012 or so, it seemed like Netflix and streaming were the future. But it, too, has had difficulty negotiating deals for desired content with the competition heating up from other services such as Amazon and HBO. Turning to Hollywood to create original content, it seemed like it was off to a good start with the series House of Cards.\nBut as A-list content dwindled, the pressure was on. Netflix had to produce more original content and it tried to hype up shows like Marco Polo which ended in failure. Shows like Orange is the New Black, Narcos, and Stranger Things helped, but rising subscriber costs contributed to its struggle2. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to see any recently widely talked about content as they ramp up efforts to try to see what sticks3.\nMany people already had Amazon Prime when they launched Amazon Prime Video. Amazon has also had mediocre success with original content. Jack Ryan is probably the most talked about, but Amazon, too, has a lengthy list of never-heard-of-this-before original content4.\nAnother popular streaming service is HBO Now, which has been able to leverage its A-list content from the cable service with clout frequently advertised by hotels everywhere, HBO. Most well known content-wise here is Game of Thrones but has done well with newer series such as Westworld and Succession.\nHBO Now is actually how I developed my current viewing habits. When it was launched I subscribed to the service just to watch Silicon Valley and then promptly canceled. An ancillary benefit was access to all the A-list content for the month.\nI started doing this around 2015 or 2016, and fast-forward to 2018 when Amazon Prime was due to be renewed. Amazon had just increased the price for a Prime membership, and the benefits were questionable. Shortly after declining to renew Amazon Prime, I also axed Netflix.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t reactivated any of these services since, but I know the desirable content has started to queue up. Jack Ryan was indeed a worthy series. So at some point, just like HBO Now, I\u0026rsquo;ll spin up a Prime Video membership for the month before canceling. This will happen with Netflix as well. Ideally I\u0026rsquo;d subscribe to a service one month and cascade other services in subsequent months.\nAn exception here is Disney Plus. The content, at present, seems to be so good that it will be worth it to just pay for the service month to month without giving it much thought. Disney Plus is also interesting because one of Netflix\u0026rsquo;s pillars is children\u0026rsquo;s content. Imagine busy parents that need an hour a day and let their kids have some screen time. Would they prefer to just pay $10 a month for Netflix or risk subjecting their kids to content from randos on Youtube5?\nIn the end it may seem rather miserly to forgo a whole $3606 a year on content and services that could prove beneficial in situations like being stuck in an airport or on a long car ride. $330, however, is a lot of money for most people. You could go out to a nice dinner for two a few times over, or buy a nicer car, or contribute that money to Watsi7. But I think it speaks more about how the business model of streaming services is broken. It\u0026rsquo;s a commodity8 and the only reason to have the service is if you truly like content that hasn\u0026rsquo;t entered the zeitgeist like House of Cards or Game of Thrones, or if you really feel compelled to have water cooler conversations about the latest episode on Monday morning. Disney Plus will be an interesting service to follow. It seems like it has the hallmark of success with so much A-list content, and if you\u0026rsquo;ve been paying attention Star Wars is everywhere.\nUpdate: I forgot I had wanted to contrast video streaming with music services (I wrote this post quickly because otherwise I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have written anything). Music services like Spotify and Apple Music are perfect for platform lock-in. It makes sense to pay $10-$15 a month.\n  Amazon took the pain away of not finding the book you want in bookstores. Similarly, Netflix took the pain away of settling for some B-list movie because there were no other options in the Blockbuster you were browsing. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/19/netflixs-original-content-strategy-is-failing/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Amazon \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://theoutline.com/post/1239/youtube-has-a-fake-peppa-pig-problem \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Services vary from $8 for standalone Amazon Video to $15 for HBO Now, but let\u0026rsquo;s just say the services on average are around $10, and for three services for 12 months it is around $360. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Do it!

        "body": "I consider myself a crypto altruist; I don\u0026rsquo;t subscribe to any sort of maximalism of any cryptocurrency. I want to see everyone have access to this technology regardless of the particular implementation, so long as it is entirely open source and has been peer reviewed by computer scientists1.\nWhen I began studying cryptocurrencies a few years ago, I recognized that they were flawed. They require untold amounts of data to store the timechain, and perhaps worse the computing power and lengthy confirmation time make monetary transactions as we know them impossible. Digging through research papers, I learned how challenging of a problem it was to ensure speed, security, and decentralization.\nIt seemed like Bitcoin \u0026ndash; and especially Ethereum \u0026ndash; were unsustainable in terms of space and computing power required, not to mention they practically violate the ethos of a decentralized money system with mining being highly concentrated2. To me, it seemed the path forward was something that worked well on mobile devices, or else how would cryptocurrency be adopted by billions of people? Since then a few solutions have surfaced that intend to work on mobile or by leveraging trusted computing centers in conjunction with a mobile solution. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if any of these will ultimately succeed, but few if any people in the crypto community seem to support them. For reference, Celo is approximately what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about here, if it works.\nFred Wilson said a couple years ago that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if Ethereum surpassed Bitcoin in value3. This makes sense as Ethereum has the potential for people to develop applications on the platform that grow in value. Ethereum has an excellent ecosystem and the tooling is fantastic4. It is likely Ethereum will end up being of some non-trivial value in 10 years because of the wealth created via Ethereum apps. I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt, however, that there will be plenty of competition. Programmers are unfortunately fickle. Ruby on Rails was the hottest thing 10 years ago, and now we have Go, Rust, Swift, Node, and dozens of frameworks that associate with those5.\nImagine a Magic the Gathering is built on Tezos or EOS or Ethereum, \u0026amp;c. It has a lot of followers that know all about the cards and play the game, creating value. A friend sends a card (token) to my wallet as a gift. Thank you, but I\u0026rsquo;m not into Magic the Gathering. My wallet tells me it is worth $250 \u0026ndash; awesome! Do I put it up for sale, hold on to it, or buy more Magic cards in hopes they will be worth even more one day? As a gift I may hold on to it, at least for some time. But likely I\u0026rsquo;ll sell it or trade it for something I am more familiar with. Cash? Gold? Those things are minted in central banks and possibly mined in asteroids6. If I want to buy a used Apple Watch or I want jewlery, sure. Instead maybe I trade it for a token that is pegged to a stock with solid fundamentals, or maybe I put it in a store of value that has proven historically to increase in value over the long term. Those seem immensely easier options. And if you are someone who dismisses crypto, read Green Eggs and Ham and then try donating to Watsi or the Internet Archive with it; less friction always wins.\nBitcoin is a store of value. It has brand recognition. The social challenge of overcoming its dominance is like campaigning Kay Jewelers to be more valuable than Tiffany. Fork market caps pale to Bitcoin, and even if they succeeded you\u0026rsquo;d still own it. Exceptional value is also Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s biggest problem. Lightning was designed to enable instantaneous low fee transactions, but you need to stake Bitcoin. As an appreciating asset why stake it? People who were early to Bitcoin and have spent it might casually participate, but the users being onboarded today are unlikely to do this. In the US there are tax implications which is a huge turnoff to spending an appreciating asset like Bitcoin. This is just the reality. Perhaps legislation changes the landscape here.\nThe development that has me convinced Bitcoin will continue to be a store of value and the dominant of all cryptocurrencies is the rise of stable coins7. Stable coins are ideally pegged to the US Dollar, and while there are small fluctuations I suspect there will soon be some kind of exemption for taxes in the US. Stable coins will be used for day to day transactions. No rational person is going to want to trade their Bitcoin if they think it is going to continue to rise in value!\nPeople will transact daily in stable coins, they will buy virtual goods on Ethereum and it will wax and wane in value, new networks will emerge and also wax and wane, but Bitcoin will remain the strongest store of value.\n  By \u0026ldquo;computer scientists\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t mean people who hold degrees necessarily, but anyone who is capable of building a blockchain from scratch. A consensus on the merits of the technology is what matters, not nitpicking. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I realize this is a contested point. Ideally you\u0026rsquo;d have x nodes and 1/x nodes odds of earning a reward, but I digress. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n People misquote him as saying \u0026ldquo;he thinks it will\u0026rdquo; when in fact he said he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I built Glossy.cards, an ERC721 creator to sell collectibles for free, using Golang with the assistance of geth, web3, Metamask, Infura. (Sure, infura is a crutch, but Ethereum is still in development). Was impressed so much production-ready infrastructure was built in such a short time. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Would be great if y\u0026rsquo;all just decided on one language for professional purposes and used the rest for hobby. I vote for a LISP; Clojure is ok I guess. Risp? Maybe something that supports tail call optimization. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Seems like science fiction, but so does decelerating rockets and landing them on small pads in a rough ocean. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n It\u0026rsquo;s not lost on me that Bitcoin could one day be measured in terms of stable coins which themselves will have intrinsic value. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

        "body": "I still go to the grocery store in part for the experience and the discovery process. Often times, however, I‚Äôve wished I could just skip the store and have the groceries appear within a day. The problem with that is then I need to sign up for some delivery service and still spend time paging through an app to find dozens of necessities.\nI have tried a few services including Instacart and Amazon Now, and both worked out fine except for the economics. On top of the cost of groceries is an added percentage, fee, and tip. What‚Äôs hard for me to understand is why these companies aren‚Äôt able to tap into the fixed costs of a traditional supermarket. While supermarket net margins tends to be around 1.7%, gross margins are in the 20% range.\nThere are over a dozen Safeway supermarket stores in San FranciscoConsidering the costs of real estate, utilities, employees, logistics, and insurance, it seems there should be enough for this service:\nInstead of 15 stores, situate 3 warehouses in the vicinity of Excelsior, Dogpatch, and Inner Sunset (i.e. highways and center of mass)Automate the warehouses so that pallets come off the trucks from supplier and are robotically transported to their row and bin; individual items are robotically retrieved to fill a shopping bagThe store employees are now delivery drivers. Bags are robotically loaded into the vans so the driver just has to get in and follow an efficient route and unload the bags to homes, offices, car trunks, \u0026amp;c.The above seems reasonably doable, so I wonder why no one does it. Even if certain aspects aren‚Äôt automated from the start, it can be done over time.\nWhat about perishable items? I think instead of bags reusable crates could be used with built in icepack. Since I consistently demolish large boxes from Amazon I‚Äôm not sure why they haven‚Äôt gone reusable yet, though with their own fleet it seems likely to be on their roadmap.\nWhat about stolen groceries? I think stolen groceries would be about as likely as stolen Amazon packages. Some neighborhoods may be more susceptible, especially in San Francisco, so having items delivered to work or a car trunk may be a solution.\nLastly, if the vision weren‚Äôt already over the top, I think combining groceries with a ‚Äúchef meal‚Äù service makes sense. That is, you get chopped vegetables and other ingredients along with a recipe so you can make a fancy dinner with ease. Maybe this would be a premium service, but hopefully far cheaper than current services with this offering.\n  "

        "date" : "2016.11.27",
        "body": "Hyperloop concept from the original SpaceX white¬†paper.Were I to create a hyperloop company I may call it R-Loop to emphasize keeping out the hype. If I was lucky maybe one day it would be known simply as ‚ÄúThe R‚Äù just as elevated trains in Philly and Chicago are known as ‚ÄúThe El.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs been just a couple years since two major hyperloop companies have been in existence and the outlook is dubious. Hyperloop One had a cofounder breakup which is often an ominous sign in startups, and there hasn‚Äôt been much news of the other company. Even if these companies don‚Äôt succeed someone will take the opportunity and figure out how to execute.\nIn a place like the Bay Area, the hyperloop could mean an alternative to local governments who refuse to build new housing. Why commute by car from Berkeley over to San Francisco which could take over 45 minutes each way, when you could hyperloop into San Francisco in 20 to 30 minutes? Even assuming self-driving vehicles eventually earn a comparable time, housing costs are still problematic.\nBrisbane, a city adjacent to San Francisco, recently rejected a proposal to build thousands of new units on this large plot of land which has two 101 exits and a Caltrain station. Driving through it at night you‚Äôd think you were in wine¬†country.I asked my friend who is a city planner from MIT what San Francisco could do to relieve the problem. He replied that properties need to stop being used as unoccupied investment vehicles and the city should let loose on high rise construction, particularly in former industrial areas like SoMa, which allows for a compromise to preserve the character of neighborhoods like Noe Valley. So far few Bay Area cities are making efforts to allow for vast new home construction.\nI realized, like many others probably, that hyperloop could solve this problem by connecting San Francisco to more rural areas and building an expandable city there. I ran this idea by my friend who told me newly planned cities almost never succeed, and it is far better to improve existing cities. But you know, Wall Street traders from Wharton and venture capitalists from Stanford and city planners from MIT excel at learning from history; one thing they have in common is they can‚Äôt predict the future very well.\nThe kind of effect the hyperloop has on society may be predicted by recalling the effects of new technologies like the railroad or air travel, but history can‚Äôt tell us what happens when we have multiple technologies that are only a decade or two old working together. Just as Tesla was able to mark billions in preorders for the Model III, we could use the Internet to propose a new city for which a hyperloop company has worked out a route. A developer could take preorders for home plans, and the hyperloop company could get to work. Some attrition may occur, but also augmentation once the city becomes a reality. Would people buy a home site unseen? For the current generation of homebuyers the answer may be yes. Everything is bought online today, even cars. What is more important is if friends are also buying in the city and how easy it is to get to San Francisco or Portland.\nBeing in such a new city provides more opportunity. Let‚Äôs assume the new city is around Eureka, CA. Someone who lives there decides to leave their San Francisco job for a job in Portland, so their commute goes from 20 minutes to 30 minutes one way. After work on Friday they decide to head to San Francisco to get an Impossible Burger at Cockscomb with old friends. No big deal, just a 50 minute hyperloop ride from work and a 20 minute hyperloop ride back home.\nHyperloop could create new cities between San Francisco and Portland.All of this is predicated on a hyperloop company successfully creating the technology and making money. But I think once that happens, public and private sectors will recognize the incredible opportunity and devote resources to seizing it. People will buy land, create crowdfunding campaigns, secure bank loans, new homes and parks will be created, new cafes and businesses will rise, and the quality of life will be among the best.\n  "
