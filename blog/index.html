        <span style="font-size:0.8em;">3 May 2019 - 5 minute read</span><br>
        <span style="font-size:0.9em;">Bitcoin has endured over a decade, and contenders are constantly being deployed. Why is it the best cryptocurrency? Here I review cash, gold, mobile, and other decentralized platforms and how they compare with Bitcoin. I consider myself a crypto altruist; I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any sort of maximalism of any cryptocurrency. I want to see everyone have access to this technology regardless of the particular implementation, so long as it is entirely open source and has been peer reviewed by computer scientists1.</span>

        <span style="font-size:0.8em;">23 Apr 2017 - 3 minute read</span><br>
        <span style="font-size:0.9em;">Why Don’t Grocery Delivery Services Have Inventory? I still go to the grocery store in part for the experience and the discovery process. Often times, however, I’ve wished I could just skip the store and have the groceries appear within a day. The problem with that is then I need to sign up for some delivery service and still spend time paging through an app to find dozens of necessities.</span>

        <span style="font-size:0.8em;">27 Nov 2016 - 4 minute read</span><br>
        <span style="font-size:0.9em;">City Planning and Real Estate Markets May Become Vastly Different If Hyperloop Succeeds Hyperloop concept from the original SpaceX white paper.Were I to create a hyperloop company I may call it R-Loop to emphasize keeping out the hype. If I was lucky maybe one day it would be known simply as “The R” just as elevated trains in Philly and Chicago are known as “The El.”
It’s been just a couple years since two major hyperloop companies have been in existence and the outlook is dubious.</span>
